      <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Challenge</h5>
      <h6 style="text-align: left;">Brief 1-Exercise: Making a prototype</h6>
      <p style="text-align: left;">As a group, our goal was to create our own working definition of ‘cooperation.’ As we did research, we arrived at our definition of 'cooperation' as two or more entities interacting to influence/affect the friction for an intended goal. Our definition of ‘friction’ was a struggle or resistance between two or more entities.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">After refining the definition of ‘cooperation,’ each group was given a day to make a prototype that could show an example of  cooperation. It could be a toy that demonstrates the cooperation, or it could be totally something else like a tool that helps to cooperate. </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">For our group, we got the inspiration from the seesaw because two people had to work together to play it. We wanted make our prototype only functional when two people use it and also can demonstrate how friction plays a role.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">We have built a table that could be only balanced with two people sitting down on the table like a seesaw. Each person had to used their thighs and arms to put pressure/friction to balance out the table. There were different types of friction in play which was interesting. For example, friction was added to hold the weight while it decreased the friction because they were sharing the weight. So when the table was balanced, the top surface became functional.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Two people where interacting with each other influencing the friction  for an intended goal which was to to use the tabletop. So they were cooperating with each other. By doing this exercise, our group could clarify more about our definition.</p>
